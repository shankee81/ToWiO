# Changing this file
# ==================
#
# You are welcome to fix typos, add missing translations and remove unused ones.
# Here are some guidelines to make sure that this file is becoming more beautiful
# with every change we do.
#
# * Change text: No problem. Fix the typo. And please enclose the text in quotes
#   to avoid any accidents.
#
#   Example 1: "When you're using double quotes, they look like \"this\""
#   Example 2: "When you’re using double quotes, they look like “this”"
#
#   The second example uses unicode to make it look prettier and avoid backslashes.
#
# * Add translations: Cool, every bit of text in the application should be here.
#   If you add a translation for a view or mailer, please make use of the nested
#   structure. Use the "lazy" lookup. See: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html#looking-up-translations
#
#   Avoid global keys. There are a lot already. And some are okay, for example
#   "enterprises" should be the same everywhere on the page. But in doubt,
#   create a new translation and give it a meaningful scope.
#
#   Don't worry about duplication. We may use the same word in different contexts,
#   but another language could use different words. So don't try to re-use
#   translations between files.
#
#   Don't move big parts around or rename scopes with a lot of entries without
#   a really good reason. In some cases that causes a lot of translations in
#   other languages to be lost. That causes more work for translators.
#
# * Remove translations: If you are sure that they are not used anywhere,
#   please remove them. Be aware that some translations are looked up with
#   variables. For example app/views/admin/contents/_fieldset.html.haml looks
#   up labels for preferences. Unfortunately, they don't have a scope.
#
# * Participate in the community discussions:

Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logistics - so variations between hubs are to be expected.

  modal_groups: "Groups / Regions"
  modal_groups_content1: These are the organisations and relationships between hubs which make up the Open Food Network.

  modal_how_shop: Shop the Open Food Network
  modal_how_shop_explained: Search for a food hub near you to start shopping! You can expand each food hub to see what kinds of goodies are available, and click through to start shopping. (You can only shop one food hub at a time.)
  modal_how_pickup: Pick-ups, delivery and shipping costs
  modal_how_pickup_explained: Some food hubs deliver to your door, while others require you to pick-up your purchases. You can see which options are available on the homepage, and select which you'd like at the shopping and check-out pages. Delivery will cost more, and pricing differs from hub-to-hub. Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logisitics - so variations between hubs are to be expected.

          overview: Overview
          overview_text: >
            Tag rules provide a way to describe which items are visible or otherwise
            to which customers. Items can be Shipping Methods, Payment Methods,
            Products and Order Cycles.
          by_default_rules: "'By Default...' Rules"
          by_default_rules_text: >
            Default rules allow you to hide items so that they are not visible by default.
            This behaviour can then be overriden by non-default rules for customers with
            particular tags.
          customer_tagged_rules: "'Customers Tagged...' Rules"
          customer_tagged_rules_text: >
            By creating rules related to a specific customer tag, you can override the default
            behaviour (whether it be to show or to hide items) for customers with the specified tag.

          hub_shop_text2: >
            Hubs can take many forms, whether they be a food co-op, a buying group, a veggie-box
            program, or a local grocery store.
          hub_shop_text3: >
            If you also want to sell your own products, you will need to switch this enterprise
            to be a producer.

            A profile makes you visible and contactable to others and is a way to share your story.
          profile_only_text2: >
            If you prefer to focus on producing food, and want to leave the work of selling it
            to someone else, you won't require a shop on the Open Food Network.
          profile_only_text3: >
            Add your products to Open Food Network, allowing hubs to stock your products in
            their stores.

            shopfront.
          producer_shop_text2: >
            A Producer Shop is for your produce only, if you want to sell produce grown/produced
            off site, please select 'Producer Hub'.
          producer_hub: Producer Hub
          producer_hub_text1: >
            Your enterprise is the backbone of your local food system. You can sell your own
            produce as well as produce aggregated from other enterprises through your shopfront
            on the Open Food Network.
          producer_hub_text2: >
            Producer Hubs can take many forms, whether they be a CSA, a veggie-box program,
            or a food co-op with a rooftop garden.
          producer_hub_text3: >
            The Open Food Network aims to support as many hub models as possible, so no matter
            your situation, we want to provide the tools you need to run your organisation or

            Producers make yummy things to eat or drink. You're a producer if you grow it,
            raise it, brew it, bake it, ferment it, milk it or mould it.
          producer_text2: >
            Producers can also perform other functions, such as aggregating food from other
            enterprises and selling it through a shop on the Open Food Network.
          non_producer: Non-producer
          non_producer_text1: >
            Non-producers do not produce any food themselves, meaning that they cannot create
            their own products for sale through the Open Food Network.
          non_producer_text2: >
            Instead, non-producers specialise in linking producers to the end eater, whether it
            be by aggregating, grading, packing, selling or delivering food.
